# Github Username Search React App
This is the first app I have created using React.

[GitHub API Project]

I split nearly each DOM element that is rendering into separate files and I am importing those files into my main file. When you put a username in the search field then it will find the username if it is valid if it is not then it will let you know.

Built this app using functions instead of classes.
